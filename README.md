# Taco Parser ðŸŒ®

C# .NET Core application that parses CSV data to pinpoint Taco Bell locations and calculates the distance between the farthest locations, aiding regional managers in strategic planning and logistics optimization.

## This project demonstrates proficiency in:
- C# programming
- .NET Core development
- Unit testing with xUnit
- CSV parsing
- Geolocation calculations

## Features:

- **CSV Parsing Functionality:** Developed and implemented CSV parsing functionality using C# to extract and process data from Taco Bell locations.
- **Distance Calculation:** Utilized the GeoCoordinate.NetCore NuGet package to accurately calculate distances between Taco Bell locations for efficient logistics planning.
- **Unit Testing:** Wrote and executed comprehensive unit tests in a Test Driven Development (TDD) procedure using xUnit to validate the functionality of the Parse method. This ensured accurate parsing of CSV data and enhanced overall code quality and reliability.

## Benefits:

- **Efficient Logistics Planning:** Regional managers can use this application to calculate the distance between Taco Bell locations, helping them understand their reach and plan future Taco Bell locations strategically.
- **Cost Optimization:** By understanding the distances between locations, regional managers can optimize routes and minimize transportation costs.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Access to accurate distance calculations empowers regional managers to make data-driven decisions about where to establish new Taco Bell locations based on customer reach and market saturation.
